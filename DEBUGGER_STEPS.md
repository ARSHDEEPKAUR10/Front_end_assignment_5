**Location:** `fetchMarsPhotos(date)` - Line 6  
**Description:**  
This breakpoint was set at the API request line (`await fetch(...)`).
It allows us to inspect the request parameters and check if the response is successful.  

**Before Stepping Through:**  
- The request is initiated but has not yet completed.  
- We check the `date` parameter to ensure it is correctly passed.  

**After Stepping Through:**  
- The response status is inspected.  
- If the response is successful, JSON data is extracted.  
- If an error occurs (e.g., invalid date, network failure), the `catch` block handles it.  

## Breakpoint 2: Processing API Response

**Location:** `photos.slice(0, 3).forEach(photo => { ... })` - Line 24  
**Description:**  
This breakpoint ensures that we correctly extract and display images from the API response.  

**Before Stepping Through:**  
- We check if the 'photos' array is populated.  
- We verify that 'slice(0, 3)'correctly selects three photos.  

**After Stepping Through:**  
- Three image objects are created dynamically.  
- The images are appended to the gallery.  

## Breakpoint 3: Initial Photo Display on Page Load

**Location:** `fetchMarsPhotos("2025-03-15").then(photos => displayPhotos(photos, "Significant Rover Mission Date"))` - Line 39  
**Description:**  
This breakpoint ensures that the page loads photos from a predefined significant mission date.  

**Before Stepping Through:**  
- The function is called but has not executed.  
- The `photos` array is empty.  

**After Stepping Through:**  
- The gallery is updated with three selected images.  
- If no photos are available, a message is displayed instead.

## Critical State Analysis: Empty API Response Handling

**Issue Identified:**  
During debugging, I found that if the API returns an empty array (`photos.length === 0`), the UI does not display a proper error message.  

**Resolution:**  
I updated the `displayPhotos` function to handle this case by adding:  

if (photos.length === 0) {
    gallery.innerHTML = "<p>No photos available for this date.</p>";
    return;
}
